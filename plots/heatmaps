##Rplot11: Heatmap of Gene Expression Across Samples##
Heading: Gene Expression Heatmap
Interpretation:
Rows represent individual genes.
Columns represent different samples.
Color intensity indicates the level of gene expression, with the scale on the right.
Yellow indicates higher expression, while purple indicates lower expression.
Conclusion: This heatmap allows for the visualization of gene expression patterns across samples, highlighting potential biomarkers or differentially expressed genes.

##Rplot12: Heatmap with Sample Clustering##
Heading: Clustered Gene Expression Heatmap
Interpretation:
Similar to Rplot1, but with samples clustered based on expression patterns.
Clustering can reveal groups of samples with similar gene expression profiles.
Conclusion: Sample clustering provides insights into subgroups within the dataset that may correspond to different conditions or treatments.

##Rplot13: Heatmap with Different Color Scale##
Heading: Alternate Scale Gene Expression Heatmap
Interpretation:
Displays gene expression with a different color scale, potentially to emphasize certain expression levels.
Conclusion: The choice of color scale can affect the interpretation of gene expression differences, making this heatmap useful for specific analytical purposes.

##Rplot14: Heatmap with Gene Names##
Heading: Gene-Named Expression Heatmap
Interpretation:
Genes are labeled on the y-axis for easy identification.
Conclusion: This heatmap is useful for quickly identifying which genes show significant changes in expression across samples.

##Rplot19: Heatmap of Principal Component Loadings##
Heading: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Loadings
Interpretation:
Shows the contribution of each gene to the first principal component (PC_1).
Conclusion: Helps in understanding which genes are most influential in the variance captured by PCA, useful for dimensionality reduction and data visualization.

##Rplot22: Heatmap with Hierarchical Clustering##
Heading: Hierarchically Clustered Expression Heatmap
Interpretation:
Both genes and samples are hierarchically clustered.
Conclusion: This type of heatmap is excellent for identifying patterns in gene expression and grouping samples based on their expression profiles.

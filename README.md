# COVID-ddPCR Reanalysis Project

## Project Overview

An independent reanalysis of publicly available droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) data from COVID-19 patients to demonstrate comprehensive bioinformatics skills, including data preprocessing, exploratory data visualization, statistical interpretation, and biological insight extraction related to viral load quantification.

## Objective

To analyze quantitative ddPCR measurements of SARS-CoV-2 viral load from publicly available datasets to:

- Clean and preprocess ddPCR count and fluorescence data for accurate analysis.
- Explore viral load patterns across patient samples with relevant clinical metadata.
- Perform robust statistical testing to identify significant differences in viral loads.
- Interpret results in the biological and clinical contexts of COVID-19 infection and recovery.

## Dataset

- Source: Public dataset from GEO (accession GSE150728).
- Description: Raw ddPCR counts and fluorescence intensity of viral targets across multiple patient samples, including clinical metadata.
- Format: Compressed RDS files suitable for direct statistical and visual analyses.

## Methods and Workflow

1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing**  
   - Download data and parse it using R and relevant libraries.  
   - Handle missing or inconsistent data points, normalizing counts for comparability.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Generate summary statistics including means, ranges, and variability.  
   - Visualize viral load distributions using boxplots, heatmaps, and scatterplots.  
   - Correlate viral load with clinical features like patient status or time points.

3. **Statistical Interpretation**  
   - Conduct group comparisons or time-series analyses using statistical tests.  
   - Assess significance and biological relevance of viral load differences.

4. **Biological Insight and Reporting**  
   - Contextualize findings with current COVID-19 literature.  
   - Provide comprehensive documentation and clear visual outputs.

## Expected Outcomes

- Cleaned, normalized ddPCR viral load dataset ready for downstream analyses.
- Visual representations of viral load trends and distributions.
- Statistical evidence highlighting key differences among patient groups.
- Interpretative insights into viral persistence, clearance, and clinical implications.
- Well-documented scripts ready for reproducibility and extension.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Data downloading, parsing, and cleaning in R.
- Proficiency with ddPCR quantitative data and single-cell RNA-seq integration.
- Statistical data analysis and visualization (ggplot2, Seurat).
- Biological integration and interpretation of complex molecular datasets.
- Creation of reproducible and well-documented bioinformatics pipelines.
